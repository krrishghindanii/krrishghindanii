**ðŸ’» I am a Web Developer, Researcher, and a Tennis Player**

I'm a freshman majoring in Data Science at the University of San Francisco. I am also a web developer, researcher, and competitive tennis player, building my version of the digital world one step at a time. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. All the projects that I have worked on are published on my GitHub.

## ðŸŒŸ Projects

- [Project 1](https://github.com/krrishghindanii/sarima-timeseries.git): This project develops a SARIMA-based forecasting system to predict Shanghai's air quality indicators (PM2.5, NOâ‚‚, Oâ‚ƒ, and others), combining historical data analysis with seasonal modeling to generate 90-day pollution forecasts. The pipeline processes real-world environmental data, visualizes trends, and produces actionable predictions to support air quality management decisions in urban areas.

- [Project 2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369228544_Evolutionary_Perspective_for_Developing_Beyond_Abacus): Currently, all over the world, teaching maths means calculations, crunching numbers mentally, solving huge number equations in the least time, what not. This research is based on bringing about a change in mathematics education by challenging the existing model of mathematics where being good at calculation or computation is treated as being good a..

- [Project 3](https://www.forbes-research.com/): Our research company is dedicated to providing high school students with limited opportunities with the tools and resources they need to succeed in writing research papers. We understand that writing research papers can be a daunting task for many students, especially those who may not have access to the same educational resources as their more privileged peers.
