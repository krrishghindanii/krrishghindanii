## üåü Projects

- [Project 1](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369228544_Evolutionary_Perspective_for_Developing_Beyond_Abacus): Currently, all over the world, teaching maths means calculations, crunching numbers mentally, solving huge number equations in the least time, what not. This research is based on bringing about a change in mathematics education by challenging the existing model of mathematics where being good at calculation or computation is treated as being good a..

- [Project 2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369228450_Maths_AI_Parallel_yet_intersecting?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6InByb2ZpbGUiLCJwYWdlIjoicHJvZmlsZSJ9fQ): Understanding students' level of math and working with them in handling their doubts, queries, deciding how they want to approach math, not only as a subject, but a way of interpreting it, thinking, living it, in a less stressed, anxiety and unnecessary troubles around it, which are generally there. We are studying uses of Artificial Intelligence (...

- [Project 3](https://www.forbes-research.com/): Our research company is dedicated to providing high school students with limited opportunities with the tools and resources they need to succeed in writing research papers. We understand that writing research papers can be a daunting task for many students, especially those who may not have access to the same educational resources as their more privileged peers.
